Version 0.9.9 (20111107, 1cad7b05da2e89ce53246f30b181159ef8fce0c3)

- Default runtime target is now BridJ: use -runtime JNAerator to retain old behaviour 
- Added option -emptyStructsAsForwardDecls to force generation of opaque pointers for empty structs (even if they inherit from other empty structs)

- Updated runtime to JNA 3.3.0

Version 0.9.8 (r2128, 20110621)

- Accept some ill-formed constructs (mismatched extern "C" { ... }) for better cross-files parsing
- Fixed JNAeration of nested dependent constants defines
- Fixed automatic macro definitions : don't override already defined macros
- Fixed parsing of singleton extern "C" definitions (without curly braces)
- Fixed issue 86 (http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/issues/detail?id=86) : generate proper array creation code for empty structs with the JNA runtime.
- Fixed issue 85 (http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/issues/detail?id=85) : generate proper constant pointer casting code for BridJ : `#define PTR ((void*)-1)` generates `Pointer<?> PTR = Pointer.pointerToAddress(-1);`
- Fixed generation of enums
- Fixed typing of (constant) boolean expressions

Version 0.9.7 (r1817, 20110329)

- Fixed generation of typed pointers (+ introduced undefined types for BridJ runtime)
- Added generation of globals for BridJ
- Added -parseInOneChunk option to control parsing more finely (forces regular, non isolated-mode parsing, which is more correct but also more fragile)
- Fixed enum renaming (issue 82: http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/issues/detail?id=82)
- Fixed unescaped quotes in string defines (issue 79: http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/issues/detail?id=79)
- Fixed some exotic function pointer syntax (issue 84: http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/issues/detail?id=84)

Version 0.9.6 (r1638, 20110204)

- Added explicit call to setFieldOrder in JNAerated JNA structures (no need for BridJ, which has its @Field annotations to guarantee proper order)
- Enhanced parsing and AST generation of C/C++ expressions
- Fixed BridJ inherited struct fields indexes computation

Version 0.9.5 (r1330, 20101011):

- Moved to JNA 3.2.7
- Support anonymous bit fields : struct S { int :7; int b; }
- Better beautification of underscored typedefs : typedef struct _Toto___ { ... } Toto; now handled properly
- Extended -I command line syntax to include files directly (which does the same as an #include statement) : files are parsed but their content is not targetted for code generation
- Added -beautifyNames switch to transform some_func() into someFunc()
(http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/issues/detail?id=59)
- Fixed names with dollars (and Scala struct field setters in particular !)
- Added -scalaStructSetters option
- Fixed callbacks fields
- Fixed studio JVM hanging issue (http://code.google.com/p/jnaerator/issues/detail?id=66)
- JNAerator Studio now launched when there's no command line args (JAR is double-clickable, at last !)
- Fixed struct** fields (PointerByReference instead of faulty Struct.ByReference[] !)
- Changed name of callbacks's single method from "invoke" to "apply" (to make them Scala-friendly)
- Fixed parsing of large files (reverted EASILY_DEBUGGABLE_BUT_FRAGILE_PARSING_MODE to false)
- Added __restrict keyword
- Added -synchronized switch to mark generated methods as synchronized (only in direct-mode JNA and BridJ outputs)
- Fixed generation of BridJ enums, constants and arrays
- Parse(skip) GCC inline assembler (__asm__)
- Parse some ObjectiveC 2 constructs : @package, @required and @optional member modifiers + new @property syntax
- Fixed parser regressions (0x7f, +10)
- Added experimental reification feature for BridJ output (-reification switch) : transforms functions that have a first "this-like" pointer argument into methods of the
corresponding pointer type. 
	Instead of getting :
	{{{
	public native static TestLibrary.GXEntity gxCreateEntity(int someParam);
	public native static void gxEntitySetValue(TestLibrary.GXEntity entity, int key,
	int value);
	public native static int gxEntityGetValue(TestLibrary.GXEntity entity, int key);
	/// Pointer to unknown (opaque) type
	public static class GXEntity extends TypedPointer {
			public GXEntity(long address) {
					super(address);
			}
			public GXEntity(Pointer address) {
					super(address);
			}
	};
	}}}
	You'd get the assembly-optimizable BridJ binding :
	{{{
	native static @Ptr long gxCreateEntity(int someParam);
	native static void gxEntitySetValue(@Ptr long entity, int key, int value);
	native static int gxEntityGetValue(@Ptr long entity, int key);
	public static class GXEntity extends TypedPointer {
			public GXEntity(long address) {
					super(address);
			}
			public GXEntity(Pointer address) {
					super(address);
			}
			public static GXEntity create(int someParam) {
					long ret = gxCreateEntity(someParam);
					return ret == null ? null : new GXEntity(ret);
			}
			public void setValue(int key, int value) {
					gxEntitySetValue(this.peer, key, value);
			}
			public int getValue(int key) {
					return gxEntityGetValue(this.peer, key);
			}
	}
	}}}

- Fixed regression with function pre-comments
- Fixed generation of references to constants defined in other libraries

- Added -ifRegexMatch switch 
- Define __STDC__ in auto configuration
